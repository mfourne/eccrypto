Name:                eccrypto
Version:             0.0.1
Synopsis:	     Elliptic Curve Cryptography for Haskell
Description:         Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Haskell, evolved for correctness and practical usability from higher-level libraries.
		     .
		     The implementation is pure Haskell and as generic and fast as reasonably possible. Timing-attack resistance is important, failure must be documented.
		     .
		     This library was formerly known and its code originated as hecc, but since this would imply Hyperelliptic ECC, the name was changed. 
		     .
		     Also the scope was changed by selecting best internal formats and no longer trying to be overly general, allowing more optimizations.
		     .
		     N.B.: F2 is faulty and slow.
		     .
		     More secure curves will be added.
